# chaosNet
# my idea for codefundo++
- An application that can help manage disaster hit areas and smoothen search and rescue operations
- The name of the app is chaosNet
- chaosNet works by making a network with all nearby devices using technologies such as WiFi and/or Bluetooth
- This network will help survivers locate eachother and will act as a beacon for the first responders
- This app will have the functionality to put the device in a headless, extreme power saving mode to act as a beacon in the even that the user of the this app is incapacitated and is not mobile
- In the future, this app can be integrated in the mobile device from factory
- Emergency first responders could be provided with a cell tower like set up that pings all nearby devices, factoring in GPS loaction of the devices to make sure the features arent misused and helps put them in aforementioned headless powersaving mode while acting as a beacon
- Has the scope to be extenended to any device that has WiFi communication capabilities irrespective of platform
- Will help account for survivors and make the process of resource alloction much more efficient 
- Internet connectivity is not an issue as the application will rely on inter-device communication rather than communication over the internet
- Can be implemented using the concept of a decentralized network 
- Only relies on common technologies such as WiFi and Bluetooth, can be implemented on most new and old devices
